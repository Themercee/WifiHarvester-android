# WifiHarvester-android
WifiHarvester is an android application to gather Wifi SSID with their signal's strength and save them for further analysis on google map.

In development, images coming soon.

## How to use it
The application is used to log the Wifi you get when you walk.
1. Start the app and click on the info button (third one) to see if you get GPS position

2. When GPS position is ok, walk around the building or place you want to log the Wifi signal

3. When finished, click on Stop (second button) to stop recording.

4. The data will be saved in the root of your SD card with the name dataSaved.json

5. Import the data with the desktop app to visualize them (desktop app coming soon on github).

## TODO
- Add a scrolling list to see Wifi with their infos
- Add some unit test
